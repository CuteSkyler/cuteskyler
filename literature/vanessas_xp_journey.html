        <label>V</label>anessa joined the game. It was a regular, nice sunny day in the overworld. Animals were roaming the planes, grass was flowing in the wind and the water shimmering in the bright sunlight.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A new player had joined, joined by the name of Vanessa. A rather unique individual, a darker skinned female donning a white cropped top shirt and a pair of ripped, highly revealing denim booty shorts. Her physique was rather tough, her stomach overlooking a hardened sixpack, her legs well defined by its calves and thighs and her arms continuing the trend by her bi- and triceps. She had the physique of a well trained woman, in all of her physical appearance she had this trait ingrained within.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa looked around upon joining; strolling around the meadows and gazing at the countless animals on display enjoying their lives, eating grass and drinking the water from a nearby lake. She enjoyed all the animals near her, they always had a cute, innocent aura to them which she enjoyed immensely.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa strolled around some more, the grass softly touching her legs while she did so, until ultimately finding a tree, and with all her might destroying it. The tree fell over in one clean sweep, her physique clearly wasn't just for show, and gained a mighty amount of logs in return. She punched and punched the other couple of trees nearby, each falling one by one by her hands alone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa had used her previously collected logs to combine them into a crafting bench. The left overs being used for the necessary equipment for the future, a pickaxe and a sword. While a sword wasn't necessary, it allowed her to not get too close to any enemies and gave her a safe distance during any encounter. A hoe wasn't necessary since she wanted to only follow her strict regimen of carnivorous endeavours, and a shovel and axe clearly weren't necessary by her ability of slamming down trees with just her brute strength alone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The sun was coming down and she hadn't even made shelter for herself yet. She was panicking; what'd she do when all the creatures of the night will show up and she hadn't any shelter? With her remaining wood, she quickly built a shelter, a very rundown little shack but it would do. She hadn't any wool or string so she had to do with waiting out the night in her little three by three shack, sans even a door. She heard the groaning of the zombies aloud through the wooden walls, she was scared for her life in there, despite her stature, she was still frightened by the dark and what it brings with it. So she sat there, awaiting morning and the creatures' death.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Six hours had passed, Vanessa had made it throughout the night without a second of sleep. She thought to herself to at least bring a bed into the next night, so she wouldn't feel as distraught, tiresome and weak the next day. And thusly, she went to the caves to find some iron to shear the sheep outside, for she didn't want to kill such defenceless creatures for just a tiny piece of wool.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa had walked to a nearby cave system, one where she had seen iron in it beforehand while strolling around the overworld. With her pickaxe and crafting bench she went in. She carefully went down step for step, ensuring she would take no damage from a fall. She had seen a few blocks of coal, those would come in handy for any future nights to ensure no nasty creatures would encroach near. She grabbed her pickaxe and swung it front and back, ensuring the block would crumble to its coal remains. And sure enough, it did, leaving behind coal and XP. She picked up the remains and suddenly felt less tiresome than before, she felt a bit more energised and active, and she felt a bit more so with each coal block mined. She felt fully engaged after mining them, as if waking up from a long and long-needed nap. She ran down the cave, excited by the prospect of getting some iron. She had finally found the ones she had seen before and mined them without a second thought. Except she had forgotten that she had not made a ston— but it mined anyway. How curious, she thought, but didn't mind it afterwards and kept on going. She had plentiful for the shears she had wanted to make and then some. She just needed some stone to make a furnace out of. She mined it out in what seemed like a quicker fashion than normal. She didn't notice and kept on doing her thing, ultimately gathering the eight needed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa had planted her furnace down, put in her iron, some coal and let it cook to finish. After a while, all her iron had finished cooking. She grabbed it and had gained some XP to go with it. She felt a very familiar sensation, a nice, warm, tingly sensation, of the XP being gathered. She felt fully energised now, able to do anything, fight anyone, climb the tallest tower, chop the tallest trees. It was a quick and fleeing sensation but she felt it fully, but quickly resumed her task at hand and made the shears for the sheep.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa went outside the cave, but unfortunately to her, it was already turning into nighttime. The creatures were showing up already, all over the place. It was a terrifying sight for her, but she had to run as quickly as she could to her shack so she could survive.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa ran, she ran as fast as she could. She ran past zombie after creeper after skeleton, all of them too slow to catch her. Until she bumped into, a rather unfortunate, zombie. She grabbed her blade and tried to defend herself. She stood, shaking in her feet, terrified at the sight of such a grotesque thing. She went in with a hack and slash until the thing finally died. It didn't drop anything of note, only some fiddly XP.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa collected the XP, but something peculiar happened to her. Already fully excited, the excess energy had nowhere to go and got stored somewhere else. She felt the XP go inside of her, past its usual destination and felt it go through her arms, legs and upper body. It was an extreme sensation of invigoration, she couldn't believe what she was witnessing. She looked upon her arm from the feeling and saw her already defined bicep swell in size and grow. All that excess energy got stored in the form of muscular mass. This discovery was one of amazement, excitement, vigour, curiosity, could she extend this feeling? Could she endure even more? Could she possibly exponentially increase its gain? All these questions brewed through her mind, all the while creatures of the night were gaining into her location.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa was still frightened by all the creatures, but less so by the realisation that all of them could lead to her towering over them, by the mere connection of them with her sword. She targeted another zombie for a quick and swift kill. The zombie had dropped more XP than the last one, and would cause an even larger surge in muscular growth in Vanessa. Collecting said XP caused Vanessa to not only increase in mass but in scale too, her height increased the tiniest bit, but her biceps have now grown significantly. All this excess power inside of her caused a vocal reaction from her, she screamed aloud at the feeling of energy getting stored as excess muscular mass, one of excitement. She needed more of this, she required more of this feeling and to endure it continuously. Unfortunately for her, the sun had begun to rise and shine, and with it, the mobs to disappear as they came from nothing. Disappointment grew over her as she saw all the opportunities for growing her muscle mass melt as snow for the sun. She began to ponder at how she could devise a way of creating a device of continually creating creatures for her to collect their XP from.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa had gathered tonnes of stone with her to create a contraption for her scheme. She had built a large tower with a stone box on top, what she had made was a box in which creatures of the night would appear in and fall down into a hole down and into the tower below, she had devised a mob farm. The mob farm didn't work extremely efficiently but it did manage to create creatures outside the confines of the night. The first one was killed without a second thought. Vanessa had grabbed her blade and slain the beast, gathering its XP. Her biceps, triceps, neck, abdominal, calve, thigh and basically all muscle groups had increased in relative size, her body gaining in total size respectively. It was now very clear she had grown very much muscular, in sheer size comparison alone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        She would continue to slay the monsters falling down consecutively. One by one she thrust her sword forward in one swift motion into each of them, breaking their feeble bones and muscular tissue, or what was left of it. The sword penetrated the zombies' rotten flesh, lack of skeletal structure and groaning spirit, sliced them in half and gathered its remains dutifully. The skeletons just as, their bones rattling together by the sheer force of the mere wooden sword clashing into them. Spiders were just as unfortunate, their trembling bodies terrified at the sight of the amazonian ebony woman slaying their kind, pitifully climbing up only to have another fall on top of them and deny them both the opportunity of life. Creepers, once the terrifying became the terrified, trying but failing at escaping or even mere suicide, getting murdered in mere seconds by the ravenous Vanessa. Other mobs fared just as bad, whether it be Endermen, witches or other forms of formidable life, once attacking her, vice versa'd, turning into mere dust and ash once they've given their last ounce of life, but providing their remains and XP for the killing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa was ecstatic at the mere enjoyment of murdering what were once the most terrifying things she could imagine, the roaming creatures of the night, without a second thought, cleanly and rapidly. XP was gathered in absolute bucketloads, what used to be done in hours turned into just one and just one turned into fractions. The more she collected, the quicker she would be able to gather, it was an exponential process, slow to start, quick to progress.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa's bodily structure adapted to the accelerated amount. Her body once slightly toned and defined was now an overly defined statue of pure muscular power. A monster slain, XP gathered. The XP's energy gathered inside of her, forming into her muscle more mass. Her muscle brewed inside, multiplying and gathering together, stronger than ever. The wobbling sound of muscular growth was audible and exciting, the sound of newly made muscular mass excited her, it was the sound of getting more powerful, to becoming something even more than before. She audibly groaned each and every time she had collected some XP, its sheer power couldn't be contained in mere whimpering or gasping, it had to be a powerful groan of excitement.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa, previously standing at an already impressive two metres in height, had increased by almost half, standing at an astounding three. While she hadn't noticed it consciously, she definitely did unconsciously, with her having to look down upon the creatures instead of level or up. She had unconscious excitement running through her, only adding to her enjoyment of it all, and adding onto her already massive muscular development, only adding to her height.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Vanessa's muscles were to boot, her biceps in rest growing from barely being defined from her skin to clearly visible and outright poking out, at mere rest position. Striking a flex was out of the question large, quadrupling in size compared to beforehand. Calves barely even visible turned into beautiful and well-defined gastrocnemius muscle tendons. Triceps, at rest, were double the size of the biceps at max size in active position. The thigh muscle groups completely dwarfing her previous stature, from softly defined vastuses to implacably well-defined hunks of beef strapped to her. Her chest — while already at an impressive size before due to her natal productivity, her breasts were plump in size and filled to the brim, her pierced nipples withstanding the brute force of liquid wanting to gush out from the pressure within — was growing at an astounding rate compared to the rest of her. While her chest wasn't broad to start with, it was at least now double its size before, its impenetrable shape and size was to be admired and astonished by. The breasts didn't grow with it, moreso growing apart due to her pectoral growth. Her abdomen were the pique of her body, akin to that of rough steel, completely indestructible and shining in the light from the sweat and left over blood droplets from current murdering of creatures. Each separate ab extremely well defined by the creases as if literal, rock-solid cubes in a roster placed by hand by how perfect they were.
